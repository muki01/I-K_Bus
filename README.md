# ðŸš™BMW I/K Bus
This code is for reading the I/K Bus in BMW Cars. With this code you can read sensor values, control lights, windows and much more.
I shared schematics with optocouplers and chips. I used Arduino nano as microcontroller, but you can use another microcontrollers like STM32, ESP32 and much more.

I will share more information about I/K Bus protocol and communication later. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰.

## This is the schematic with Optocouplers
